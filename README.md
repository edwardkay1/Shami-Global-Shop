🛍️ NkoziMart — WhatsApp-Powered Local Commerce
NkoziMart is a streamlined, efficient marketplace designed to connect local buyers and sellers directly through WhatsApp. It bypasses the need for traditional e-commerce accounts or integrated payment gateways, making transactions simple, fast, and personal.

✨ Key Features
🛒 Seamless Shopping Experience: Buyers can easily browse products, add them to a virtual cart, and place orders with a few taps.

🤝 Direct Seller Communication: The platform automatically groups cart items by seller, allowing buyers to place orders directly via a pre-filled WhatsApp message.

🛍️ Seller-Centric Management: A dedicated dashboard empowers sellers to manage their product inventory and profile.

📊 Admin Control Panel: An administrative interface provides oversight and control for the platform owner.

💾 Persistent Cart: The cart's contents are saved in local storage, so buyers can return to their session without losing their selections.

🧠 How It Works
Browse & Build a Cart: A buyer explores the homepage and adds desired products to their cart.

Order via WhatsApp: From the cart, a buyer can initiate a conversation with each seller.

Automatic Message Generation: A single button click generates a pre-formatted WhatsApp message for that seller, listing the items and quantities ordered.

Example message:

Hi [Seller Name], I would like to order the following:

Mandazi Combo (UGX 2,000)

Blue Band Sachet (UGX 1,500)
Total: UGX 3,500
Thank you!
